      <p>We bring deep knowledge about how technology can help drive change in cities and communities. We keep an eye on what technologies are being introduced into the planning world, and where they fit in a process. We have the technical expertise to build tools when it is the right thing to do, and we have the experience to guide planners through what the right thing to do is.</p>

      <p>One thing our experience has reaffirmed repeatedly is that there is still plenty of room and need for innovation in the way planning is done. To that end, we are excited to bring new methods, ideas, and products into the realm of planning.</p>
